man on fire,hard,"Thanos was born an ugly duckling; misshapen and contorted into what appeared to be a little beast. Born on Saturn's Moon of Titan, to a colony named The Eternals — Thanos grew up angry and jealous of his attractive and easy-going brother Starfox. Much like his appearance, Thanos was very different than his tribe. While The Eternals sought a life of happiness and community, Thanos sought out personal power, strength and authority. It did not take long before Thanos was exiled from his birthplace and forced to travel the universe. During his time in space, Thanos had the misfortune of meeting a villain named Death. His love for her caused him to travel the universe in hopes of finding the all-powerful Cosmic Cube. This cube would allow him to become god-like, and with this complex magic, he would be able to make Death love him in return. However, when Thanos failed to keep the cube in his position, Death cursed him by rendering him immortal. Thanos' powers include: superhuman strength, invulnerable skin, the ability to project psionic blasts of energy as well as plasma energy from his eyes and hands and an impenetrable mind."
